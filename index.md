## T.I.M.E Stories package for Octgn

Welcome Time agent! Here you'll find image package for fan-made expansions of T.I.M.E Stories. If you like an expansion, please make sure to tell the creator on bgg! If you want your expansion to be added here please contact me (KertanLeGnome) on bgg. You can find an explanation of what I need [here](set) (don't worry, it is really simple). I will shortly add support for providing a translation to an existing scenario.

All the sets (even some of the official expansion) will be distributed with the game package directly when installed in octgn. However, the image packs need to be added or else all cards will appears blank. I wont provide image packs for official expansion, you will need to scan your own cards! A way to add them to octogn will be given shortly.
