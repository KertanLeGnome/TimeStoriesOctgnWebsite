## How to add your expansion in the package

If you have any question or if your expansion doesn't fit with the provided framework, please contact me on bgg to see if I can make it work.  

I only need two things to be able to include your expansion into the game. First of all I need a excel (or equivalent) file containing all the cards in the expansion. Here is an exemple of the file for prophecy of dragon:

![exemple excel file](cards.PNG "Exemple excel file")

There are 5 columns in this excel file, leave unneeded parameters empty.

1. Type of the card
2. Location of the card
3. Space where the card will go
4. Phase where the card is used, if needed
5. The number for element cards

There are several type of cards available to you:
* **Location** Cards that will deploy on the a-h spaces
* **Element** Self-explenatory
* **Plan** Initial map cards
* **Conclusion** Card to read at the end of a run
* **Receptacle** Initial receptacle cards
* **Reminder** Cards use for remembering symbols or special rules
* **CodexX** Cards placed in codex X (1 to 6 for now in case you need more than 4).

Location cards need to have a Location name in the "Location" column, such as "Base" or "Tavern". Players will open location based on this name so make sure it is the same than on the map. 
The Space column is required for "Location" and "Plan" card. For location, it refers to which space (from a to h) where the card will go once the location is opened.
